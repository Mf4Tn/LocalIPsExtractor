# LocalIPsExtractor
Efficiently extract active local IPs with ICMP pinging in this C# tool, simplifying network management tasks.

This C# application automates the process of extracting active local IP addresses within a specified range. Leveraging the power of network scanning through ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) pinging, the program systematically checks for active IPs within the local network. Upon detecting an active IP, it adds it to a list, providing users with a comprehensive overview of available local IPs.
